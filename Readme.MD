#RehersalAttend 
A rehersal attendance manager

#Setup
Create `config.php`
Add dependencies to `/vendor/` using composer (in `libs/composer/composer.phar`)

##Important Notes
You must ensure that the `/database/` directory is inaccessible - the `.htaccess` file included will work - but only if override is enabled in your web server's settings
